                <p>My name is Ashley Hamilton Morley, a Brock Univeristy graduate, Software Developer, and life
                    long lerner Looking to gain employment I first became interested in Developing for
                    the web and video games when I was a child, my constant curosity and gravitation toall thingns tech
                    left me with the desire to answer the questions of how and why things
                    work the way they work came down the instruction of it all, the code.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Some of my favorite
                    technologies to work with for Web Development include, HTML5, CSS, SASS, and JavaScript all of
                    which was used to create this website. More specifically I am well versed in Javascript languages
                    such as , NPM, NODEJS, Express.js, Vue.JS and react JS just to name a few.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Additionally some of my favorite programming languages for developing console and desktop
                    techologies include Java and C#. For Game Development tools I have are expereience in mainly
                    Unity3D and Blender.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    When I'm not Developing however, I love playing video Games, making music and hanging out with
                    friends. I'm mainly a console gammer and I've been playing guitar for about 12 years now. However,
                    my passion is in programming and it's with my my hope that some day with the help of this websites
                    I'm fortunate enough to be employed with the title of developer in either the Web or Gamming
                    industry. Employers Feel free to use the contact page to send me a message if your interested below
                    is a breif history of my work experience.</p>
